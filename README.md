# SIMPLE SHELL

The project consists in implementing the sh in C programming language. The goal of this project is to write a simple UNIX command interpreter.

## Description

The shell is a command line interface (CLI) program which provides an environment to connect the Linux user and operating system. It helps to get input from the user through commands, operate the function based on input and return the outpout on the terminal.

## Requirements

### General


- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- Your shell should not have any memory leaks
- No more than 5 functions per file
- All your header files should be include guarded
- Use system calls only when you need to

### List of allowed functions and system calls


- **access** (man 2 access)
- **chdir** (man 2 chdir)
- **close** (man 2 close)
- **closedir** (man 3 closedir)
- **execve** (man 2 execve)
- **exit** (man 3 exit)
- **_exit** (man 2 _exit)
- **fflush** (man 3 fflush)
- **fork** (man 2 fork)
- **free** (man 3 free)
- **getcwd** (man 3 getcwd)
- **getline** (man 3 getline)
- **getpid** (man 2 getpid)
- **isatty** (man 3 isatty)
- **kill** (man 2 kill)
- **malloc** (man 3 malloc)
- **open** (man 2 open)
- **opendir** (man 3 opendir)
- **perror** (man 3 perror)
- **read** (man 2 read)
- **readdir** (man 3 readdir)
- **signal** (man 2 signal)
- **stat** (__xstat) (man 2 stat)
- **lstat** (__lxstat) (man 2 lstat)
- **fstat** (__fxstat) (man 2 fstat)
- **strtok** (man 3 strtok)
- **wait** (man 2 wait)
- **waitpid** (man 2 waitpid)
- **wait3** (man 2 wait3)
- **wait4** (man 2 wait4)
- **write** (man 2 write)

## Output


- Unless specified otherwise, your program must have the exact same output as sh (/bin/sh) as well as the exact same error output.
- The only difference is when you print an error, the name of the program must be equivalent to your argv[0] (See below)

## Tasks


0. README, man, AUTHORS

- Write a README
- Write a man for your shell.
- You should have an AUTHORS file at the root of your repository, listing all individuals having contributed content to the repository. Format, see Docker

1. Betty would be proud Write a beautiful code that passes the Betty checks

2. Simple shell 0.1

Write a UNIX command line interpreter.

Usage: simple_shell

Your Shell should:

- Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line.
- The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed.
- The command lines are simple, no semicolons, no pipes, no redirections or any other advanced features.
- The command lines are made only of one word. No arguments will be passed to programs.
- If an executable cannot be found, print an error message and display the prompt again.
- Handle errors.
- You have to handle the “end of file” condition (Ctrl+D)

You don’t have to:

- use the PATH
- implement built-ins
- handle special characters : ", ', `, , *, &, #
- be able to move the cursor
- handle commands with arguments

execve will be the core part of your Shell, don’t forget to pass the environ to it…


3. Simple shell 0.2

Simple shell 0.1 + Handle command lines with arguments


4. Simple shell 0.3

Simple shell 0.2 +

- Handle the PATH
- fork must not be called if the command doesn’t exist

5. Simple shell 0.4

Simple shell 0.3 + Implement the exit built-in, that exits the shell Usage: exit You don’t have to handle any argument to the built-in exit


6. Simple shell 1.0

Simple shell 0.4 + Implement the env built-in, that prints the current environment
